# Typography & Grid Challenge

-------------------------------------------------------
This is a work in progress, based off of [an older repo](https://github.com/javasteve99/startup-institute-type-files).
-------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of starter files and resources for the Typography ESD at [Startup Institute Boston](http://startupinstitute.com/) and the Typography & Grid Challenge in the [AUX](http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/aux/) program at Fresh Tilled Soil.

Presentation slides are hosted on [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/javasteve99/typography-fundamentals).

### Practice
[Shape Type: A Letter Shaping Game](http://shape.method.ac/

### Exercise 1
The PDF has the string hamburgefontsiv written on it in several typefaces, but each version is missing a different letter. Choose a string and use the existing characters as a reference to draw the one that is missing. An answer key PDF has also been supplied, which can be referred to after the exercise  in order to check performance.

### Exercise 2
Choose two words and create a typographic treatment for them that visually reinforces their meaning/relationship. Start by creating at least 5 different sketched compositions of the same word pair. Pick one sketch and use any graphics editor, or pen/pencil, to develop it into a more finished and polished composition.

### Exercise 3
Using the starter code in this repo, which contains typical article markup, implement a set of type styles that demonstrates the skills you’ve learned today. If time allows please go beyond just choosing typefaces and a hierarchy and create a fully designed article experience that could be carried across other articles if necessary. Apply the system to a second article to demonstrate that it works properly.
